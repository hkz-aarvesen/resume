I get back from vacation and see a bunch of nonsense about you leaving :disappointed:
It's been really great working with you Alan, wondering why there was a dude named Alana at the company remains one of my fondest memories from the old days.
You've really provided a great example of what a senior engineer should be and I've tried to learn a lot from you; about not taking things personal, about fully exploring issues and considering all angles, and about being a pleasant coworker and leader.
Thanks for everything, and hope your future endeavours are awesome!

Them:
You will be incredibly missed here
I hope the next step of your journey is way more exciting than the emptiness left here! (edited) 
Me: 
Haha.  Next step is time off, at least for a few months.  We’ll see how long it goes until I get bored.  Or start a pod cast, that is what all the cool folks do today.
Them:
LOL
Nice!
Make sure you post everywhere so that I can listen to it.

Just saw your message in wpefriends.  :cry:   Still vividly remember you taking time to talk to me about things before I joined engineering in the 8th floor atrium.  Don’t remember if I thanked you for that.  so :thanks:.

bro
:cry-proud:

@Alan Arvesen, my dude.
It was a pleasure to work with you, to absorb your experience in my WPE n00b days, to bask in your genuinely positive energy.
Your EFFN|Hackathon|allTheThings introductions are and will remain treasures in my long-term storage.
Thanks for being here and being awesome. :wpe_heart:
And good luck with all the things. :rocket:

It was nice fundamentally changing IE with you (et al). Thank you for your service. :salute:

---
Oh man Alan this is heavy. I have learned so much working with you. Thank you for always keeping things light and showing your smiling face at every turn. I’ll miss you man!


---
Thank you so much for all your contributions not just in growing our technology and best practices, but growing our engineering talent as a mentor and model of engineering excellence. You sir can never be replaced here and will be greatly missed!

---
We will miss you a tone! You were able to create amazing atmosphere and be an amazing support to us all!

---
One of my very first impressions of WP Engine was from being interviewed by Alan, being able to learn from him is one of the reasons I decided to join. I’ve learned quite a lot from him in our relatively short year together, you’re a true role model Alan! I’ll definitely miss getting to chat with you in ND3 and as others have said, WPE will miss you a ton.

---
oh no, not Alan!
certificate expiry
comes for everyone

---
We're going to miss you Alan!

---
P.S. I legit teared up finding out your last day is later this month. I respect the hell out of you and wish you all the best.

---
I heard you're leaving. You one of the faces that I think of when I think of WP Engine, and you will be missed.

---
I heard you are leaving WPE at the end of the month. We are losing such an amazing person with your departure! I am so very glad that I had the chance to work with you!

---
I am on talent conference prep and heard some sad news.  I am SO GONNA MISS YOU!
I know it's not leaked yet and won't help that news spread, but you are one of the greats! 

---
Hey man! I just heard word that you are leaving WPE. That is a bummer but I hope you are moving on to something that you are excited about! Thank you so much for the help and mentoring you've given me over the years!

Hello
I’m on vacation in Kentucky or somewhere with trees
But I have a jillion emails about you saying bye without saying bye. So bye. It’s been absolutely nothing short of a pleasure working with you and I am grateful for all your coolness

Alan, thank you for all your massive contributions to WP Engine. Most importantly you brought true self to work everyday to everyone’s benefit. Thank you for leaning in with courage to tackle our hardest challenges and for raising your hand to drive fun team experiences. I really admire your sense of humor.   I hope this break brings you some time for reflection and solace. I would love to work together again and you will always be warmly welcomed here!  Thank you Alan!!!!

Hey Alan. "You're going to be missed" is an understatement. I've enjoyed working with you over the years and especially when we were together in CSI. Thank you for everything that you've taught us and for being an inspiration. Best of luck for whatever is next!

Always enjoyed when our streams crossed, best of luck duder!

So sad to receive your farewell email! I wish you a bright and happy future wherever you land. We will miss you!

I wish I could make it to your hh tonight, but alas I cannot. It's been a pleasure, sir.
Thanks for always adding a bit of levity to tense situations. I was always glad-er to be working a SEV or an INC or whatever when you were present.

---
Also, it's been an absolute pleasure working with you. Will definitely miss having you around, best of luck on what's next

Wish you the best of luck for the next phase !   I will miss you at work !

Hey man… just want to wish you the best before you go and note the great irony that your departure comes at a time when the advancements in AI make Handshakez seem much more feasible to me. The tech world turns…

### Education

Bachelor in Philosophy

### Relevant Technical Skills
UNIX hack, past perl guru, former Java expert, versed in C and shell scripting. Conversant in numerous languages of various strengths and types: VB, awk, sql, html, javascript, ruby, groovy, python, golang, php, more. I easily pick up new languages and technology. My editor of choice is still vi.


### Relevant Professional Skills
I communicate effectively on a business as well as a technical level. I view code as a tool to solve the problems that people and businesses have, and I have an innate feel for when those problems are best solved via code and when they are best solved via other means. Results are more important to me than technological dogma. 

## Work Experience

*January 2015 - Present: WP Engine
Senior Staff Engineer, Engineering Manager, Principal Engineer*


WPEngine is the pre-eminent managed WordPress host.  Application stack is hosted 100% in the cloud, mainly at AWS and GCP.  Each year I worked on something different: the php API and billing migration, AWS infrastructure and clusters, Rails front end hosted on Heroku, golang SSH backend in Kubernetes, managing two teams that worked on the PHP and the WordPress stack, and most recently on the SRE team.

WPEngine is where I became interested in running great teams.  What could I do to make my team better, and to measure my success by my teams’ successes?  How could I ensure that not only myself but my whole team was delivering?

I set out to make the workplace be the kind of place I wanted to be at.  I took over the bi-weekly staff meeting and changed it into a late night show format. I organized Chaos Weeks to practice chaos engineering.  I organized and taught a section of an R&D new employee orientation.  I organized events around fixing our monolith (“Nasboxxening Days”).  I re-organized our Hackathon presentations to run smoothly.  I strove to have a greater impact than the delivery of code by a single person.  I wanted to be a force multiplier.

July 2013 – January 2015 : MyDocket
Principal Developer
------

Small Austin Ventures startup that did sales enablement.  The django/psql backend was hosted on AWS, code hosted in github, most local development on Macs.  I was exposed to python, new features in Postgres (windows, common table expressions), modern javascript (require, jQuery, grunt, jasmine), and the AWS ecosystem (EC2, EBS, S3, cloudfront, etc).  Had my hands in each piece of the stack from front end JS; build automation and continuous integration; experimental OpenOffice integration; third party integration with Salesforce, Crocodoc, and Linkedin; SQL query reporting and optimization; AMI creation and deployment; ansible scripting; and who knows what else.

The company went through several pivots. Original product was a pure django system for “hosted showrooms in the cloud”.  Next iteration moved the focus to “sharing content in the cloud”.  Then we moved into gmail integration, and then we moved fully to email tracking via gmail.  Final iterations included an Outlook plugin written in C#.

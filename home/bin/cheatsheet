USAGE

}

#-------------------------------------#
#  And all the cheats.
#  Philosophically, splitting the text from the code is desirable.
#  Logistically, a single file is easier.
#
#  The DATA filehandle is formatted as follows:
#
# - A bunch of colons is just a separator, or a comment if you like
# ::::::::::::::::::::::
#
# - Three colons and a word is a named cheat
# ::: somecheat
#
# - For a special case: a named cheat can be a synonym for another.
# This is so you can keep the cheat alphabetized for your own sanity
# But note that you can make this an endless loop if you really want.
# So don't do that.
#   Format is this cheat name - colon- the synonym.
#   For example: as far as cheats are concerned, dc is a synonym for bc
# ::: dc:bc
#
# - Otherwise, it's just text associated with the most recently named cheat

** invocations **
$ gdb -P $(pidof something)         attach to pid and start debug session
$ gdb -x initfile                    execute gdb commands in "initfile" before debugging.
                                     helpful for storing breakpoints.
$ gdb -iex "set auto-load safe-path $(pwd -P)"
                                     allow auto run, so you can load the python dasboard from https://github.com/cyrus-and/gdb-dashboard

** commands **
break filename:lineno          good for putting in init file
b *0xsomeaddress               break on this addresss (such as the ret line in the disassembly of main)
bt                             backtrace; shows the current stack
directory some/path/name       add directory to source path
disas main                     disassemable main
disas anotherfunc              disassemable a function named 'anotherfunc'
fin                            finish == step return
find location,+bytes,value     search memory for a value ('help find' for more options)
info frame                     show current frame informatoin
info locals                    show local vars
info registers                 show registers
i r ebx                        shorthand for "info registers ebx"; show value of only ebx
si                             single step (into) instructions
si 16                          step over 16 instructions (one "line" when displayed x/64x)
ni                             next intstruction; step over instructions

p/x $eax & 0xff000000          print as hex the result
p/t $eax & 0xff000000          print as binary the result
p system                       print the address of the system call
p $_siginfo._sifields._sigfault.si_addr
                               print where the sigsegv just happened

set disassembly-flavor intel       show intel rather than AT&T output
set pagination off                 turn off more
set {int}($ebp-0x84) = 0x804931f   set the memory address specified to the integer value 0x804931f

x/64x $sp-200                  eXamine (i.e. print)  memory values (first x) for 64 bytes as bytes (second x)
                               start from the stack pointer minus 200 bytes
x/s   $sp-200                  examine the memory as if it was a string (from stack pointer - 200)
x/i   $pc                      examine assembly instruction of current line
x/s   $ebx                     examine the string that is in the memory location of $ebx (right?)

::: journalctl

journalctl -u consul                            show journal for the "consul" unit (eg service)
journalctl -u consul --since "10 minute ago"    show consul jorunal for last 10 minutes
journalctl --list-boots                         list reboots (questionable accuracy.
                                                  Also see 'last reboot')

** show journal since last invocation consul
journalctl _SYSTEMD_INVOCATION_ID=$(systemctl show -p InvocationID --value consul)
Explanation:
   _SYSTEMD_INVOCATION_ID=... is a general journalctl "FIELD=VALUE" search. See "man systemd.journal-fields" (!!)
   the systemctl call:
        -p InvocationID    show this property
        --value            but only print out the value
        consul             for this particular unit

** Nomenclature **
DN                        Means "disinguished name".  The fully qualified entry,
RDN                       Relative distinguished name.  One of the parts of the DN.
                          The left most identifier is often called "the RDN"
DC                        Domain component.  One of the parts of the DN.  Same as "an" RDN.
CN                        Common or Canonical Name.  A common domain component.
                          For x509 (i.e. TLS) certificates, this usually needs to be the hostname
                          that is presenting the certificate.
"uid=alan,ou=People"      Whole thing is DN.  "uid=alan" is "the" RDN.  "ou=People" is "an" RDN.

** Querying **
(uid=alan)                exact match
(uid=alan,ou=People)      exact match with multiple RDN
(uid=a*)                  wild card match
(!(uid=a*))               NOT filter
(|(uid=a*)(uid=b*))       OR filter
(&(uid=a*)(uid=b*))       AND filter
(&(objectClass=Person)(|(sn=Jensen)(cn=Babs J*)))    Composite (a & (b | c))

** LDAP URL-like SYNTAX FOR SSSD  **
search_base[?scope?[filter][?search_base?scope?[filter]]*]
ou=People                             just the search base
ou=People?onelevel                    search base plus scope (base, onelevel or subtree)
ou=People??(|(uid=a*)(uid=b*)         search base plus filter (note no scope so "??")
ou=People???ou=Robots                 two search bases (note "???" for empty scope and filter, and
                                      a final "?" to indicate new URL)

** LDAP TOOLS **
ldapvi -h ldapi:/// -Y EXTERNAL -b cn=config                     ldap vi locally, 'base' set to cn=config
ldapsearch -Q -LLL -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -b cn=config dn      print distinguished names from base (?)

ldapwhoami -d 1 -H ldaps://your-host -D 'cn=bogus' -w your-pass  try to ask server 'your-host' who the DN 'cn=bogus'
                                                                 is when passing 'your-pass'.  Use '-d 1' to turn
                                                                 on debugging output.  Helpful for diagnosing connection
                                                                 problems.  Error -1 means can't talk to server, error 49 means bad pw
